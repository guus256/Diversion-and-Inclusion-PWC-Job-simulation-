## Introduction
The telecom client's HR team is striving to improve gender balance at the executive level but has seen little progress. To support their diversity and inclusion goals, I analyzed company data and created a dashboard that highlights key insights and areas for improvement, helping the company foster a more diverse workforce.

## Project Overview
Human Resources at a telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. For this reason, clients seek support with diversity and inclusion. The company needs a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in the increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. With the data provided by the company, analysis was done and the following dashboard was created.

## Insights
- Males dominate hiring across all job levels, with 59% of total hires being male, while females account for 41%.
- Female promotion rates vary across job levels, but overall, women are underrepresented, especially in senior roles (e.g., Director with only 15.8% female promotions).
- The average time in grade for promotions shows that males tend to stay longer in each role compared to females before being promoted.
- Female turnover rate is 11%, with higher average performance ratings for those who leave (3.00) compared to those who stay (2.67) while male turnover rate is slightly lower at 9%, with a similar trend where leavers have higher performance ratings (3.67) compared to non-leavers (2.52).
- Performance ratings for both genders are closely matched, with an average rating of 2.42 for females and 2.41 for males.
- There is a significant gender imbalance at the executive level, with males comprising 87.5% in FY20 and 84.2% in FY21.
- The 20 to 29 age group has the highest representation across the organization, followed by those aged 30 to 39.

## Recommendations
- Increase female represenation in leadership.
- Address gender disparities in promotion rates.
- Focus on retention of high-performing females.
- Balance the age group representation.
- Montor hiring and promotion practices.
